# Advent of Code 2023

## Run

`run.sh` script usage:

```
In main directory:
    ./run.sh <path/to/cpp_file> <input_file>
```

The script:

1. Compiles the `.cpp` file.
2. Runs the executable with `<input_file>` as argument.
3. Save the output as text file into `outputs/` folder.
4. Remove executable file.
